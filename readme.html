h channel-dependent deficit of theta oscillation resonance and phase shift 
in temporal lobe epilepsy,
Neurobiol Dis. 2008 Dec 16. [Epub ahead of print]

In the paper, this model was used to confirm and support experimental data
suggesting that the neuronal/circuitry changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy,
including Ih-dependent inductive mechanisms, can disrupt hippocampal theta function.

The simulation theta.hoc reproduces the upper left trace in Fig.5A of the paper.

Be aware that the simulation is rather long (several hours).

Under unix systems:
to compile the mod files use the command 
nrnivmodl 
and run the simulation hoc file with the command 
nrngui theta.hoc

Under Windows systems:
to compile the mod files use the "mknrndll" command.
A double click on the simulation file
theta.hoc 
will open the simulation window.

Under MAC OS X:
Drag and drop the extracted theta folder to the mknrndll icon.
Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file to the nrngui icon
